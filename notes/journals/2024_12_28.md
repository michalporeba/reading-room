- Listening to [[The Power of Geography]]
	- Chapter 8 - [[Ethiopia]]
		- A land-locked but surprisingly affluent with water country in the horn of [[Africa]]
		- [[Ethiopia]] was never colonised.
		- [[Ethiopia]] is built [[Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam]] to improve it's energy generation capability, but the dam is on [[Blue Nile]] and could be used to control significant proportion of [[Nile]] flow in [[Egypt]]. At one point during the construction [[Egypt]] threatened to bomb the dam as they considered it a threat to their security. So did Sudan. While [[Egypt]] was primarily considered with water being cut off, [[Sudan]] was primarily worried about being flooded should the dam fail.
	- Chapter 9 - [[Spain]]
		- Spanish national anthem has no lyrics as nobody can agree what they should be.
		- Many countries have water disputes with their neighbours, like [[Ethiopia]] in the previous chapter. Spain has internal water disputes between its regions.
		- [[Quote]]: Spain is a nation state of nations.
