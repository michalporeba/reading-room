- Listening to [[Chip War]]
	- In [[1973]] [[Lynn Conway]] joined [[XeroX]] after leaving [[IBM]] in [[1968]]. At the time the chips were still designed by pencil on paper, transistor by transitor, edging elements often cut with a knife, and miniaturised. Conway saw this as a limiting factor and applied architectural thinking moving the design from transistor to transistor, to component by component. This led to development of software packages for designing chips, and to the ability of students being able to design chips in classrooms, and have them built within months by the industry, something that led to acceleration of the chip design in the states, and ultimately cemented the role of the US as a powerhouse of chip design despite the capability to produce them slipping away to Japan and other countries. 
	  (This is not the same Conway as [[Melvin Edward Conway]], the one known for [[Conway's Law]]).
	- The Conway lead changes to chip design are often called Mead and Conway revolution in a very large scale integration design.
	- The author suggests that the dominance of the american chip design that led to ending the [[Cold War]] after the US shown their potential with advanced weapons during the [[Gulf War]]. The [[Soviet Union]] realised, that despite superiority in the nuclear arsenal, and raw power, they would be unable to compete with far superior weapons powered by microchips. This might have been the common thinking at the time, but current world events suggest that while highly sophisticated, and therefore highly expensive weapons can be successfully used to dominate smaller countries, a conflict with large country, like then the [[Soviet Union]], but today [[Russia]], or perhaps [[China]] has a great potential in turning into an attritional war in which the volume of cheap, but mass-produced weapons is at least as important as the level of advancement in a given technology.
