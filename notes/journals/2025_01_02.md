- Listening to [[Bullshit Jobs: A Theory]]
	- Bullshit jobs are jobs which don't contribute to society, are meaningless, but pretend not to be so. A negative example is given of an assassin. While assassins don't add to society, they don't pretend to do so, and therefore the profession cannot be classified as a bullshit job.
	- Bullshit jobs are not shit jobs. Often the opposite is true, the non-bullshit jobs tend to be shit, as in low paying, and not respected, while the bullshit jobs come with a lot of money and status.
