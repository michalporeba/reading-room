- Reading [[Ultimate Data Engineering with Databricks]]
	- [[Quote]] from back cover: Ultimate Data Engineering with Databricks is a comprehensive handbook meticulously designed for professionals aiming to enhance their data engineering skills through Databricks.
	- The quote explains the book very well if read carefully. The author presents a lot of data engineering concepts (although the engineering is broad enough to include analysis and perhaps data science) on an example of Databricks. It is not a book to learn more about Databricks with, but rather to learn more about data engineering.
