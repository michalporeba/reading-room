- Listening to [[Chip War]]
	- [[Intel]] was the last company outside of Asia, outside of [[Samsung]] and [[TSMC]], who was producing modern technologies, but they appear to have dropped out of the race, or at least fallen significantly behind at the level of 5nm in the late [[2010s]]
		- Under [[Xi Jinping]], since [[2012]], [[China]] followed a new direction. "There is no security without cyber security. There is no modernisation without computerisation", is something he believed. The country got heavily involved in chip economy becoming the largest consumer of the technology. Their national growth as well as oppressive practices of the regime heavily depended on America-designed, and Taiwan-produced chips, many of them [[IBM]] manufactured. The [[2013]] leaks by [[Edward Snowden]] has exposed the level big American corporations collaborated with the state in espionage, news that lead to 20% drop in IBM products sell in China, and even bigger drive of China to become independent of western chip technologies. This, eventually led to the current shift away from x86 architecture which for years dominated the servers and desktop computers, making even the biggest countries like [[Russia]] and [[China]] to be dependant on Intel, AMD, and Microsoft.
