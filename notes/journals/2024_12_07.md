- Reading [[Kafka: The Definitive Guide]]
	- The book starts with history of how the project started at [[LinkedIn]], why and who was involved, including [[Jay Kreps]] leading the development who previously worked on open-source [[Voldemort]] - a distributed [[key-value storage]] system. The team included also [[Neha Narkhede]] and later [[Jun Rao]].
	- [[Kafka]] is "a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log service"
	- request processing is split between two groups of threads with data in-between. There are network threads, request queue, IO threads, response queues, from which data is picked up again by the network threads.
	- [[Kafka]] uses [[zero-copy]] method when responding to requests. This means, the data is not buffered in the process, it is sent directly from the disk to network ensuring high performance. On [[Linux]] this is likely to be from the file system cache to network.
	- Consumers can read only messages that have been replicated to all in-sync replicas. The last replicated message offset is called "high water mark".
	- Kafka was first published in [[2010]]. The book was published in July [[2017]]. The versions discussed are 0.9 and 0.10 as it was 4 months before release of version 1.0. Currently the most up to date version is 3.9.
