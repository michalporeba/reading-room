- ## Notes
	- A book I picked up hoping to learn more about specific Databricks solutions to organise better work around a Databricks platform.
	- Unfortunately, the book is primarily about basics of working with data, with a lot of good, but basic explanations, for example what is data quality and why it matters.
	- In the introduction it is explained that the target audience of the book are beginners to experts. I think beginners could get a lot of value of it it learning about data and using Databricks to experiment with what they learn.
